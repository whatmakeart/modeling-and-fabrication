## Re-Export Tool Paths

After you modified the ply thickness, re-generate and re-export your tool paths with the DXF post processor. In the manufacture workspace, right click on the process and click generate. Then click on post process to export a new DXF. Make sure you label the dxf exports so you know which one is the most recent.

If you have a complicated model with etching or interior pocket cuts, you can make these as different profile cuts in the Fusion 360 manufacture workspace. Then you can check the box to export each operation as a different layer. This can be helpful to select the paths in Illustrator and make them different colors. You can order the cuts on the laser cutter by dragging and dropping in the Epilog print menu. It is a good idea to do all etching and interior cutting before cutting the outside contours so you pieces do not move.

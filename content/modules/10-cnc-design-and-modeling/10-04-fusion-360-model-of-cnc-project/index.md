2. Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Project Model.f3d
3. One Rendering of CNC Project with appearances applied. Should be in a 4:3 1:1 or 16:9 aspect ration with one side at least 4000px (.png or .jpg)
4. Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Project Rendering.f3d
5. One screenshot of parts layed flat in the manufacture workspace. (.png or .jpg)
6. Label file YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Project Parts Layed Flat.f3d

## Assignment Overview

1. Using your revised sketches and scale cardboard model, identify the different parts of your project. Each of these parts will be a different component in the Fusion 360 model.
2. Think about how you will construct and assemble the pieces. Will you use tabs and slots? How will they work?
3. Remember that the CNC can not cut a square inside corner so you need to add dogbone or T-Bone fillets. Think about how you add to fillets so you can conceal them. This [video](https://youtu.be/fjrEmJeM-qw) shows how to add invisible dogbone fillets to your model. You can add them when the model is assembled or when it is laid flat. [https://youtu.be/fjrEmJeM-qw](https://youtu.be/fjrEmJeM-qw)

Lay all of the parts flat after the design is complete. Use arrange to place them on a virtual 48"x48" piece of plywood or on a 96" x 48" piece of plywood. Take a screenshot or rendering of your parts laid flat. Make a rendering of your assembled piece with appearances applied. Export your .f3d Fusion 360 file.

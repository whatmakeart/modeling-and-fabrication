## Deliverables

Upload a minimum of 1 render image of the Fusion 360 Modeling Exercise.

Label your exported render image:

- YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Modeling Exercise Render.png

## Instructions

Watch the [Fusion 360 3D Modeling Exercise](https://youtu.be/arTAFuBS-qI) video. This walks you through modeling your first part in Fusion 360. It introduces sketches, sketch constraints, appearances as well as rendering. Follow along and make the part from the example. You can use the sketch below for reference. Select the material of your choice, it doesn't have to be wood and it doesn't have to be the same material on each face. Experiment and see what happens.

Export a render of your part as a PNG.

Label the render image file and upload it.

Once you finish this exercise, try to model a creation of your own. Don't worry about making mistakes, just experiment. We will talk more about modeling techniques next week and throughout the semester.

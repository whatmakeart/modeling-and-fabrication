<p>Project Documentation is due before the final critique, uploaded to Google Drive. Make sure you make your reservation soon enough to have enough time to assemble your project, apply finishing and take documentation photos.</p>
<h2>ShopBot Reservation Time</h2>
<p>Make sure you reserve enough time to cut your project. If there is not enough time and the next student has a reservation, you will need to stop your cut. This can waste your plywood and time.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will take ~ 30 minutes to set up the tool and have your plywood in place.</li>
<li>Look in Fusion to get an estimate of your machine time</li>
<li>Multiply machine time by 1.2 to add 20% buffer time.</li>
<li>~5-10 minutes to remove material from machine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add everything together and make a reservation that is long enough.</p>
<p>You will need to make multiple reservations since the default reservation is 1 hour.&nbsp;If you need a 2 hour reservation, reserve&nbsp; two 1 hour slots. If you need 2 hours and 30 minutes then reserve three 1 hour slots in a row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must go to your reserved time because there are limited slots. The shop will let me know if you do not attend. You can cancel your slot but you must do it a minimum of 48 hours in advance. You then have to make another reservation.</p>

<h1>Purchase Plywood</h1>
<p>After you make your Fusion 360 model of your CNC project, lay the parts out flat. Then look at the size of the sketch that you needed to use in the Arrange command to lay your parts flat. This will let you know how much plywood that you need. You can buy plywood in 48"x48" or 48"x96" or 60"x60". It comes in a range of thicknesses. Stop by the Fab Studios to see the plywood in person. Then purchase the right size board for your project. If your model is just a bit over you may be able to fit the last piece on someone else's scrap.</p>

## Overview

This module covers technical sketching and an introduction to 3D modeling in Fusion 360. 3D modeling software used for fabrication and manufacturing incorporate tools based on technical sketching. In order to understand the digital 3D modeling tools it is important to have a basic founational understanding and proficency in technical sketching.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice technical drawing and sketching techniques
- Draw isometric cubes and circles
- Sketch objects using thrid angle projections
- 3D model a basic object in Fusion 360
- Create a rendered image of a 3D modeled object in Fusion 360

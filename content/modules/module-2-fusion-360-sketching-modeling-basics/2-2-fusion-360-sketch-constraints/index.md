## Fusion 360 Sketch Constraints

Fusion 360 uses digital sketches to describe and define 3D geometry. The sketches can have precise hard coded dimensions but sketches can also use constraints for efficiency and flexibility.

For example, instead of labeling all 4 sides of a square as 50mm, it is possible to label one side of the square 50mm and apply and "equal" constraint to the other sides. They will be equal to the first side. This makes it easier to make design changes since only one dimension needs to be updated instead of four. Continuing the square example, it is possible to give a 90 degrees dimension to all the angles of the square or a simpler way would add a "perpendicular" constraint to the corners of the square.

Fusion 360 has many different useful sketch constraints including horizontal/vertical, coincident, tangent, equal, perpendicular, locked, midpoint, concentric, colinear, symmetry, and curvature. Using these constrains in combination with dimensions and defined user parameters you can create a "fully defined sketch" in Fusion 360. The goal is to fully define each sketch you create in Fusion 360?

## What is a fully defined sketch?

When new sketch lines ore elements are drawn in Fusion 360 they appear blue, indicating that there is not enough information to determine how the line or rectangle should appear. It could be missing a dimension, not know what angle it should be at, not know where the line starts or stops, or many other "undefined" aspects of the sketch. If a sketch is not fully defined then small changes can have big effects and can move parts of your design around in unexpected and frustrating ways. Once everything is defined, then the sketch lines turn black and a red padlock appears on the sketch name in the outliner, indicating that the sketch is fully defined.

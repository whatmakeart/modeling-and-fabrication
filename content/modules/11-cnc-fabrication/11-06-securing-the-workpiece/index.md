## Securing the Workpiece

On the laser cutter we merely set our piece inside the cutter and don't need to hold it down. The router is a much larger and powerful machine and will knock the workpiece all over the place causing damage and potential injury. We need to firmly secure our material to the router table before using the machine. It is important to make sure that any Fasteners used to secure the workpiece do not come in contact with the spinning router bit.

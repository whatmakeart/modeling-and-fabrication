## Overview

This module introduces 3D Printing and mesh modeling sometimes referred to as polygon modeling.

We will not only 3D model on our computers, we will output our digital models into the physical world. 3D printing is a quick way to be able to hold a complex 3D model in your hands. Some models can only be made by 3D printing. 3D printing is an additive process, meaning material is added to existing material rather than being cut away such as with a saw.

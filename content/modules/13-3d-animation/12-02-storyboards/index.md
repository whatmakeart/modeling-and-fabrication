[Link to Printable Storyboard Sheets](./storyboard-template.jpg) You can print these for free in black and white in the classroom or in the library.

Make storyboards for your animation. Since the animation is 15-30 seconds long, you need a minimum of 15 storyboard panels. Remember to change angle and scale for each shot / scene / animation.

You can print out the template from the course Google Drive Handouts Folder. To have 15 storyboard panels you need to use three pages of the storyboard template. Write down the type of shot on each panel. Write a brief description of what is happening. If you have a 15 second animation then each storyboard panel represents 1 second of animation. If you have a 30 second animation then each storyboard panel represents 2 seconds of animation. Plan accordingly so you do not have too much action or too little action.

Scan your storyboards as a PDF. Label the PDF YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Animation Storyboards.pdf.

Take a minimum of two photos of your model. Take one from a 3/4 angle that shows a good representation of the form. Take the other from a composition of your choice.

Set up lights and a clean backdrop. You can check out lights and a camera from the CIA equipment checkout. You can also take your model to the think[box] and use the soft boxes and flashes already set up. Shoot in JPG and RAW and post process the images. [White balance should be corrected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0yZEWUSahk) and the levels should be adjusted to have good exposure. Use Photoshop and [Adobe Camera Raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jwSwUu2WI) to make adjustments and to retouch any mistakes in the images. Label the photos YYYYMMDD CNC Cardboard Model

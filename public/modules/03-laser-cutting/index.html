<h3><a class="title-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-00-introduction/">3.0 Introduction</a></h3>

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-00-introduction/">
    Overview This module introduces laser cutting as a digital fabrication process. Laser cutting can cut all the way through a material or etch on its surface. Laser cutting is a quick way to rapidly prototype and test ideas and concepts. It can make parts with high accuracy and repeatability. It is limited to creating flat pieces of relatively thin thickness.
Learning Outcomes Use Adobe Illustrator to make laser cut file for test cut Use Epilog laser cutting software to cut and etch wood and plastic Create iterative designs and ideation sketches Refine designs for assembly and fabrication Fabricate scale models in cardboard

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-01-laser-cut-test-file/">
    We will go to the think[box] to learn how to use the laser cutters. We will each make a test cut from a file that we make. You need to have this file made before going to the think[box]. There are specific instructions to make the file in Adobe Illustrator. If you do not follow the directions then your file will not work properly on the laser cutters.
The test cut will demonstrate the ability of a through cut and an etching cut on the laser cutters.

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-02-ideation-sketching/">
    What is Ideation Sketching? Ideation sketching is an important part of the creative process. There are many ways to make and generate ideas. The simplest way is with small thumbnail sketches with a pencil on paper.
Draw sketches that convey your idea and excite the viewer. Also draw sketches that explore how your concept could possibly be assembled and made.
Sketches can be made with analog techniques, digital techniques, or a combination of both.

<h3><a class="title-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-03-cardboard-construction/">3.3 Cardboard Construction</a></h3>

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-03-cardboard-construction/">
    Cardboard is a great material for making prototypes. As a material, it is relatively cheap, easy to find, strong and lightweight. In fabrication it can be cut, sanded, bent, fastened and glued. Multiple layers of cardboard can be built up to make a panel a desired thickness.
Tab and slot cardboard construction techniques allow a design to assemble and disassemble without glue. This can be helpful when a design might be changed or when the final design may also use slot and tab construction such as in laser cutting.

    Design Laser Cut Phone / Tablet or Laptop Stand - Design Research We will use the power of parametric modeling in Fusion 360 to design a phone, tablet or laptop stand that will be laser cut out of plywood or acrylic. The laser cutters can cut plywood and acrylic from 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; thick.
This project will use the entire design process.

    Assignment Deliverables Minimum 10 Ideations Minimum 3 refined Sketch Ideas Label your scanned sketches - YYYYMMDD Lastname First Name Project Name / Description
Ideation Sketches After initial design research, begin by drawing ideation sketches of solutions. At this stage try to draw many different ideas without censoring your thoughts. No idea is bad at this point. Draw many ideas with different contours and solutions to the problem. Draw a minimum of 10 ideation sketches of different designs and ideas.

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/03-laser-cutting/3-06-laser-cut-cardboard-models/">
    Assignment Deliverables 1 Cardboard full scale model Physical Test Model Choose one of these drawings Get some cardboard. There is some in the classroom. Use good clean cardboard rather than old, torn, and bent cardboard so you are not fighting the material. Make a 1:1 scale model. This means real world scale. If you are using 1/4&quot; plywood or acrylic, then make your cardboard the same thickness. We want the model to be accurate and full scale so we can test our ideas quickly.

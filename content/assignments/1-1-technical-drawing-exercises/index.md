<p>Watch the sketching videos below. These videos show you the needed technical sketching tools. They also demonstrate how to practice drawing straight lines freehand. This is an important skill for ideation sketching, 3D modeling sketching and isometric crating. The videos then demonstrate how to draw an isometric cube with isometric circles on each face of the cube freehand. This is followed by a demonstration of how to draw an isometric cube with isometric circles on each face using a t-square, 30 / 60 triangle, and a compass.</p>
<p>Using loose sheets of paper, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> in your sketchbooks, do each of the exercises on your own.</p>
<h2>Page Filled with Straight Lines</h2>
<p>Draw a minimum of 1 page filled with straight lines. It is a good idea to do this multiple times until you get the hang of it. It will help you in your sketching in all of your classes. Draw from the shoulder.</p>
<h2>Freehand Isometric Cube with Circles</h2>
<p>After you have a page of good straight lines, then follow the video to draw an isometric cube with circles. Do this freehand. Freehand sketching is import for quickly communicating ideas, generating ideations, and solving design problems.</p>
<h2>Isometric Cube with Circles using Drawing Tools</h2>
<p>Once you finish the freehand isometric cube, draw the same cube on a new sheet of paper but this time use your drafting tools. Although freehand sketching is great and very important, often we have to take our freehand sketch ideas and refine them for presentation.</p>
<h1>Instructions for Using Scanner to Turn in your Sketches</h1>
<p>When you finish your sketches scan them and upload them to the class Google Drive following the instructions below.</p>
<p>You can use the scanners on the 3rd Floor, in the Library, in 205 or in 302. Make sure that the scan is clear and with good contrast, not too dark or too light. Make sure you select color or grayscale and not document or black and white. Document or black and white will make the image look harsh.. Label your scans YYYYMMDD Lastname First Name Project Name.jpg</p>
<p>How to use the fast "Scan and Send" - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWOLqHkWMGfwWOzTNK44yLmmdhtQ3IYZ/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWOLqHkWMGfwWOzTNK44yLmmdhtQ3IYZ/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>A scanner is the best way to digitize your paper sketches. A camera may also be used but you must take special care to not have shadows or image distortions. If using a camera, place a light on one side of the piece of paper, then put a large white panel on the other side. The light will bounce off the panel and act as a second light. Make sure the camera is behind the lights and is square to the image so there is not distortion. Adjust the levels of the image in Photoshop for proper white balance and contrast.</p>
<h2>Google Drive Upload Folder</h2>
<p>Upload labeled scanned sketches in a labeled folder to this Google Drive Folder. There is a completed example project in the Google Drive Folder for your reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IFhtHM3gXbWqrODvZjRQ1TCIvlHP9xPH">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IFhtHM3gXbWqrODvZjRQ1TCIvlHP9xPH</a></p>
<p>You will upload three separate, labeled JPEGs in a labeled folder.</p>

## Assignment Overview

Take a minimum of two photos of your 3D Test Print. Take one from a 3/4 angle
that shows a good representation of the form. Take the other from a composition
of your choice. This could show some detail of the print. Make sure the print is
in focus. Using a camera from the checkout with a zoom feature will help.

Set up lights and a clean backdrop. You can check out lights and a camera from
the CIA equipment checkout. You can also take your model to the think[box] and
use the soft boxes and flashes already set up. Shoot in JPG and RAW and post
process the images.
[White balance should be corrected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0yZEWUSahk)
and the levels should be adjusted to have good exposure. Use Photoshop and
[Adobe Camera Raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jwSwUu2WI) to make
adjustments and to retouch any mistakes in the images. Label the photos YYYYMMDD
3D Test Print

- Use good lighting and shoot in JPG and RAW so you can edit and post process
  your images.

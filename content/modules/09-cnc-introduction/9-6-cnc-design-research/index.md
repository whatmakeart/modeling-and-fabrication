We will continue learning parametric modeling in Fusion 360\. Parametric modeling allows us to change our design depending on the materials that will be used to fabricate it as well as certain parameters that we might want to change for different users. In this project we will design a stool, chair, end table or another large supportive device with an intended purpose such as perfectly holding a PS5.

Stools come in different heights and we may want to easily customize a stool with the same design but fabricate it at a different height without actually remodeling everything. With parametric modeling we can set the height of a stool as a user parameter in our model and then have other dimensions of the design driven by that height. Simply typing a new value for the height will update the rest of the model.

In the previous project we learned about user parameters. We will continue to use user parameters in our designs and learn how to use formulas to make other dimensions driven by parameters.

In this project it is important that your 3D Digital Model is robust. What does that mean to have a robust model? When you use the dimension of ply for the thickness of the plywood you should periodically test different values of "ply" and any other user parameters that you have set. Check to see if you model updates and each piece is referenencing the size of other pieces. It is a good idea to change to value of ply each time you make a new component or piece of your model to make sure all the parameters are changing the model as expected.

# Design Process

## Research

Before starting your project it is important to see what types of designs have been made. This can give you inspiration and new ideas for your project. You do not research other designs to copy them but to find out solutions that others have made. You can then take inspiration from those solutions and create your own designs and Concepts. This is an important part of any creative process.

## Collect Images

1.  Collect a minimum of 10 images of existing designs. You can take screenshots or download the images.
2.  Organize the images into a folder called “CNC Design Inspiration Images.” Label each of the images with a descriptive title that includes the creator’s name.
3.  Put each of these images into a Google Slides Presentation. Use one slide per image.
4.  On each slide write 2-3 sentences about why you selected this image and what your find intriguing about it.
5.  Put a link on each slide to where you found the image.
6.  Save the presentation as a PDF YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Design Inspiration
7.  Upload the PDF and the folder of Images to Google Drive

## Research Design Parameters

Look up standard stool heights, chair sizes, and table sizes. You can simply enter these search terms into Google. Write down what you find. You do not have to make something a standard size but generally it is a good place to start your design process.

# Design Requirements

- Support the weight of a person or the intended item
- Have considered aesthetics
- Use 1/2" or 3/4" plywood
- Use more than 1 type of joint
- Have a considered and designed top surface, this could have engraving or decorative joints
- Be a relatively standard size
- Fit pieces on a half sheet of plywood or full sheet of plywood

## Ideation Sketches

1.  Make a minimum of 10 thumbnail sketches of ideas. Keep the ideas varied and different. Push yourself to be inspired by designs you researched but to come up with your own ideas and concepts.
2.  After making initial sketches, choose 5 ideas and make larger refined sketches. You may need to draw these from different views and show details of how you plan to join the pieces together.
3.  Choose your favorite idea and draw a larger final sketch. This could be a third angle projection drawn by hand or with a t-square that includes the Front, Top and Right views. It could also be a detailed rendered iage that is descriptive of its form and construction. Put dimensions on you drawing.
4.  Scan or photograph your sketches. If using a scanner, make sure that the DPI is high enough and that the exposure on the scanner captures enough detail, especially if you have light sketches. If you are photographing your sketches, ensure that there is even lighting, no shadows. Make sure that there are no extra items in the photo. Make sure there are no distortions or trapezoid shapes from taking the photo at an angle. Keep the camera square to the paper.
5.  Label you files YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname CNC Ideation Sketches
6.  Upload to Google Drive

## Make a Scale Cardboard Model

<div class="flex-container-jimmy" style="display: flex; align-items: top; flex-wrap: wrap; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">

<div class="half-box" style="flex: 1 1 400px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">

Make a cardboard model of your design. It is one thing to draw with pencil on paper, it is another to make a physical object. Problems and solutions that may not be apparent in your drawing will reveal themselves when you make a physical object. The model will be smaller than actual size.

You can cut the cardboard with hand tools or the laser cutter or both.

We will be using ¾” or ½” plywood for this project. You can use a ratio to scale your model.

Measure the cardboard and use a ratio calculator to scale your model dimensions.

First calculate the scale factor of your materials. If your single sheet of cardboard measures ~3.3mm and 3/4" plywood is ~18mm then you have a scale factor of 11:60\. This website can easily calculate the scale factor for you. [https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/cm_to_inch/scale_factor_calculator.html](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/cm_to_inch/scale_factor_calculator.html)

Once you know the scale factor then you can determine how big the pieces of your cardboard model should be based on that scale factor. This website lets you enter a scale factor and then enter in your final desired design dimension. For example if you want something 30" tall, you put in a scale factor of 11:60, type 30" in the "real length" and set the "scale length" to mm to get the scaled model size in mm. (You can use inches for your cardboard model but millimeters are soooo much easier to use, count, divide. Notice I put in 30" because for some distances I know imperial units better but then I quickly convert to the easier to use metric system. Make sure you always double check your units.) This website will scale all your numbers. [https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/cm_to_inch/scale_converter.html](https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/cm_to_inch/scale_converter.html)

## Overview

We will continue learning parametric modeling in Fusion 360. Parametric modeling allows us to change our design depending on the materials that will be used to fabricate it as well as certain parameters that we might want to change for different users. In the previous project we learned about user parameters. We will continue to use user parameters in our designs and learn how to use formulas to make other dimensions driven by parameters.

## Learning Objectives

- Conduct design research on existing CNC fabrication and design solutions
- Use ideation sketches and iteration sketches to design a structure for CNC fabrication
- Scale cardboard to different plywood thicknesses
- Fabricate accurate, scale cardboard model of sketches of CNC design
- Understand the difference between laser cutting and CNC machining

## Key Terms

- Parmetric Modeling
- CNC
- Router
- Dogbone Fillet
- Invisible Dogbone aka T-bone
- Pocket Cut
- Lap Joint
- Mortise and Tenon Joint

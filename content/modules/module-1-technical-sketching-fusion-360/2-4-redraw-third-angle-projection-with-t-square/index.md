Choose one of your third angle projections. Do not pick one that is too simple or too complex.

You will need your drawing board, T-Square, 45 degree triangle, 30/60 degree triangle, compass and ruler.

If your object is small, use a scaled ruler to scale the drawing up with 2mm = 1mm. [Here is a link to a scaled ruler that you can print out](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iOUYnB3zUVdPLuCxPrcEScaPrNB-L8Qk/view?usp=sharing)[.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Rce9jzU2jIDPkyK7TRkl3_fJcH4L74E/view?usp=sharing) This ruler has 2mm marks divided into 10\. There are many other scaled rulers available online. If you object is larger, such as a Wii controller, then you can draw at scale with 1mm = 1mm.

Draw a neat and accurate third angle projection. Use your T-Square and triangles. Label each view, Front, Top, Side/Right. Label all the dimensions. Use your T-Square and triangles to draw straight lines for the dimensions. Think about where you put the dimensions so it is clear and legible by anyone.

<p>We will begin 3D modeling in Fusion 360. Make sure you created an Autodesk account and have Fusion 360 installed. Contact Jimmy at <a href="mailto:jkuehnle@cia.edu">jkuehnle@cia.edu</a>&nbsp;if your have any issues.</p>
<p>Watch the video about the <a href="https://youtu.be/YjaxBbTY3kc">Fusion 360 User Interface</a>. It explains how Fusion 360 works with project files. It also shows how to navigate in 3D space with your three button mouse. Fusion 360 is a parametric modeling program and therefore has a timeline with all of the features of your 3D model. We will discuss the timeline, user parameters, model browser and many other topics as the course progresses. This video gives you the information that you need to get started in Fusion 360.</p>
<p>Then watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/arTAFuBS-qI">Fusion 360 3D Modeling Exercise</a> video. This walks you through modeling your first part in Fusion 360. It introduces sketches, sketch constraints, appearances as well as rendering. Follow along and make the part from the example. You can use the sketch below for reference. Select the material of your choice, it doesn't have to be wood and it doesn't have to be the same material on each face. Experiment and see what happens.</p>
<p>Export a render of your part as a PNG. Label the file and upload it to Google Drive following the instructions below.</p>
<p>Once you finish this exercise, try to model a creation of your own. Don't worry about making mistakes, just experiment. We will talk more about modeling techniques next week and throughout the semester.&nbsp;</p>

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/01-technical-sketching-fusion-360/1-0-introduction/">
    Overview This module covers technical sketching and an introduction to 3D modeling in Fusion 360. 3D modeling software used for fabrication and manufacturing feature tools based on technical sketching. In order to understand digital 3D modeling tools it is important to have a basic foundational understanding and proficiency in technical sketching.
Learning Outcomes Practice technical drawing and sketching techniques Draw isometric cubes and circles Sketch objects using third angle projections 3D model a basic object in Fusion 360 Create a rendered image of a 3D modeled object in Fusion 360

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/01-technical-sketching-fusion-360/1-1-technical-sketching/">
    Technical sketching is a form of drawing used to visually communicate how and object is made, put together, or how something functions. Often dimensions of the object are written on the sketch as well as the precise scale of the drawing. A scaled drawing allows for small and large objects to be drawn at a reasonable size rather than their respective real world scale. Even if a drawing is not to scale it can still describe the form of the object.

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/01-technical-sketching-fusion-360/1-3-third-angle-projections/">
    Third angle projection is a method of drawing a three dimensional object on a two dimensional plane or piece of paper. It is a type of orthographic projection that shows how an object looks from different directions on the same drawing. The different views line up and can be used to project dimensions from one view to another view using orthogonal (perpendicular) lines. The three views are front, side and top.

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/01-technical-sketching-fusion-360/1-4-draw-two-objects-in-third-angle-projection/">
    Assignment Deliverables Upload 2 separate, labeled JPEGs of 2 different objects drawn in third angle projection on paper. One is drawn freehand and one is drawn with technical drawing tools.
Label the files:
YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname object in third angle projection freehand.jpg YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname object in third angle projection tsquare.jpg Instructions Select two objects of reasonable size and complexity. You do not want super tiny objects or mega huge objects.

<a class="summary-link" href="/modeling-and-fabrication/modules/01-technical-sketching-fusion-360/1-5-fusion-360-introduction/">
    We will begin 3D modeling in Fusion 360. Make sure you created an Autodesk account.
Watch the video about the Fusion 360 User Interface. It explains how Fusion 360 works with project files. It also shows how to navigate in 3D space with your three button mouse. Fusion 360 is a parametric modeling program and therefore has a desing history timeline with all of the features of your 3D model. We will discuss the timeline, user parameters, model browser and many other topics as the course progresses.

    Deliverables Upload a minimum of 1 render image of the Fusion 360 Modeling Exercise
Label your exported render image:
YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname 3D Modeling Exercise Render.png Instructions Watch the Fusion 360 3D Modeling Exercise video. This walks you through modeling your first part in Fusion 360. It introduces sketches, sketch constraints, appearances as well as rendering. Follow along and make the part from the example. You can use the sketch of the part below for reference.

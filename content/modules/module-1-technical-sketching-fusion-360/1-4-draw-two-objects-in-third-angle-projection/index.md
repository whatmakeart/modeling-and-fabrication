## Deliverables

Upload 2 separate, labeled JPEGs of 2 different objects drawn in third angle projection.

Label the files:

- YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname object in third angle projection 1.jpg
- YYYYMMDD Lastname Firstname object in third angle projection 2.jpg

## Instructions

Select three objects of reasonable size and complexity. You do not want super tiny objects or mega huge objects. You also don't want objects that are a simple square or objects made of hundreds of intricate parts.

Using loose sheets of paper, <span>not</span> in your sketchbooks, draw the three objects that you selected.

Use digital calipers to get the dimensions of the objects. Write the dimensions on your third angle projections. Use mm for your units. Mark metric somewhere on the page and note the units as mm.

You should draw these sketches freehand without using your drafting / technical drawing tools. Drawing accurate third angle productions freehand is an important drawing communicative skill.Â  The lines do not need to be perfectly straight or perfectly proportioned but try to make sure that the drawing is an accurate representation of the object. Measure the proportions and keep everything aligned.

Next week we will draw third angle projections using our technical drawing tools. Drawing third angle projections, freehand and drawing third angle projections with technical drawing tools are both important skills for designing, communication and ideation.

<h2 id="what-is-a-story-spine">What is a Story Spine?</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvbegQPV7Z1sd126H0XWCh8iD4bNExQ4/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=103106537131131071355&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true">Link to Blank Fillable Story Spine Sheet</a></p>
<p>Spend a few minutes to write a brief Story Spine that follows a narrative arc. Remember that the project does not have to have any narrative structure. It can also be an abstract visual experience. Nevertheless any sequence of images will have some structure even if that structure is to intentionally disregard structure. Think of your structure as having 3 parts.</p>
<p>In part 1 explain the setting of the animation. Where is it? What is seen? What is happening? What is the subject?</p>
<p>In part 2 introduce a problem, conflict or goal. Where is the ball going? What does the ball want to do? Is everything exploding and on fire? Or is is a tranquil and peaceful setting where the problem is that the ball is bored?</p>
<p>In part 3 resolve part 2. What is the result of the actions of the ball after encountering part 2? How does the ball escape the fire or stop being bored?</p>
<p>Writing a Story Spine and Storyboards will give you an outline and direction as you produce your animation materials. Rather than working with everything possible in the universe, the Story Spine and Story Boards will narrow the scope and set limitations that you can work creatively within.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-story-arc">What is a Story Arc?</h2>
<p>A traditional story arc contains an introduction of the story, plot, characters and setting. This is called the Exposition. This leads into the Rising Action when the character is faced with a problem. The character then confronts obstacles along the way toward the Climax of the story, a moment of crisis that directs the rest of the plot. This is followed by Falling Action as the plot moves from climax to the ending. Finally a Resolution occurs and stability returns to the story.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exposition</strong> – intro of plot, characters and setting</li>
<li><strong>Rising Action</strong> – multiple incidents occur providing suspense and tension</li>
<li><strong>Climax</strong> – moment of crisis that directs the rest of the plot</li>
<li><strong>Falling Action</strong> – plot moves from climax to ending</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong> – final results of plot - stability returns</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="story-spine-structure">Story Spine Structure</h2>
<p>A story spine is a concept created by Kenn Adams in the book &ldquo;The Art of Spontaneous Theater.” <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It is a simple outline with prompts that assist a storyteller develop a structure for their narrative. We will use this 9 part structure to develop our animations to have 3 simple acts.</p>
<h3 id="3-act-narrative-story-spine-structure">3 Act Narrative Story Spine Structure</h3>
<p>You will use the story spine as the foundation for your 3 act narrative structure.</p>
<p><strong>Act 1 – The first 3 parts of the story spine</strong></p>
<p>This act sets the scene, introduces characters, shows how the world works. The act leads up to having have the rising action of &ldquo;But, one day&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<ol>
<li>Once upon a time&hellip;</li>
<li>Every day&hellip;</li>
<li>But, one day&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Act 2 - The Journey or the &ldquo;Because of that&hellip;&rdquo; Sequences</strong></p>
<p>Show the journey of the character and how they overcome obstacles that they encounter. Often includes a low point of the character&rsquo;s journey. Hardship comes to the character as they experience a low point. A series of challenges is presented that lead to the climax or a fork in the road where a decision must be made. After this diction is made that there is often no going back.</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of that&hellip;</li>
<li>Because of that&hellip;</li>
<li>Because of that&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Act 3 - Heading toward the climax and resolution</strong></p>
<p>The characters must make a choice to overcome the obstacles of Act 2. This the “Until, finally…” climatic moment of the story arc. This moves the story toward conclusion and resolution. The character demonstrates learning and growth. This often demonstrates the moral of the story.</p>
<ol>
<li>Until, finally&hellip;</li>
<li>And, ever since then&hellip;</li>
<li>And the moral of the story is &hellip;.</li>
</ol>

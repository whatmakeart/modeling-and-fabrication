<h1>Draw Three Objects in Third Angle Projection</h1>
<p>Select three objects of reasonable size and complexity. You do not want super tiny objects or mega huge objects. You also don't want objects that are a simple square or objects made of hundreds of intricate parts.</p>
<p>Using loose sheets of paper, <span>not</span> in your sketchbooks, draw the three objects that you selected.</p>
<p>Use digital calipers to get the dimensions of the objects. Write the dimensions on your third angle projections. Use mm for your units. Mark metric somewhere on the page and note the units as mm.</p>
<p>You should draw these sketches freehand without using your drafting / technical drawing tools. Drawing accurate third angle productions freehand is an important drawing communicative skill.&nbsp; The lines do not need to be perfectly straight or perfectly proportioned but try to make sure that the drawing is an accurate representation of the object. Measure the proportions and keep everything aligned.</p>
<p>Next week we will draw third angle projections using our technical drawing tools. Drawing third angle projections, freehand and drawing third angle projections with technical drawing tools are both important skills for designing, communication and ideation.</p>
<h1>Instructions for Using Scanner to Turn in your Sketches</h1>
<p>When you finish your sketches scan them and upload them to the class Google Drive following the instructions below.</p>
<p>You can use the scanners on the 3rd Floor, in the Library, in 205 or in 302. Make sure that the scan is clear and with good contrast, not too dark or too light. Make sure you select color or grayscale and not document or black and white. Document or black and white will make the image look harsh.. Label your scans YYYYMMDD Lastname First Name Project Name.jpg</p>
<p>How to use the fast "Scan and Send" - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWOLqHkWMGfwWOzTNK44yLmmdhtQ3IYZ/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWOLqHkWMGfwWOzTNK44yLmmdhtQ3IYZ/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>A scanner is the best way to digitize your paper sketches. A camera may also be used but you must take special care to not have shadows or image distortions. If using a camera, place a light on one side of the piece of paper, then put a large white panel on the other side. The light will bounce off the panel and act as a second light. Make sure the camera is behind the lights and is square to the image so there is not distortion. Adjust the levels of the image in Photoshop for proper white balance and contrast.</p>
<h2>Google Drive Upload Folder</h2>
<p>Upload labeled scanned sketches in a labeled folder to this Google Drive Folder. There is a completed example project in the Google Drive Folder for your reference.</p>
<p>You will upload three separate, labeled JPEGs in a labeled folder.</p>

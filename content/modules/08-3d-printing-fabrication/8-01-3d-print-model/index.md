The 3D print will be a solid color of PLA plastic or ABS plastic at the DOC or many different multicolors from the industrial printers at the think[box]. Choose a color and apply that material to your model. Set up a render scene with a 1:1 or 16:9 or 2:3 aspect ratio. Make one of the dimensions a minimum of 4000px. Export a render image with a good composition. Don't make the object too small in the image.

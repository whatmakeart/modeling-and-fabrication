## Assignment Overview

## Process

1.  Make a minimum of 10 thumbnail sketches of ideas. Keep the ideas varied and different. Push yourself to be inspired by designs you researched but to come up with your own ideas and concepts.
2.  After making initial sketches, choose 5 ideas and make larger refined sketches. You may need to draw these from different views and show details of how you plan to join the pieces together.
3.  Choose your favorite idea and draw a larger final sketch. This could be a third angle projection drawn by hand or with a t-square that includes the Front, Top and Right views. It could also be a detailed rendered image that is descriptive of its form and construction. Put dimensions on you drawing.
4.  Scan or photograph your sketches. If using a scanner, make sure that the DPI is high enough and that the exposure on the scanner captures enough detail, especially if you have light sketches. If you are photographing your sketches, ensure that there is even lighting, no shadows. Make sure that there are no extra items in the photo. Make sure there are no distortions or trapezoid shapes from taking the photo at an angle. Keep the camera square to the paper.

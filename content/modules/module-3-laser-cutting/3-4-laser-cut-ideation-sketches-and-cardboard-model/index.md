We will use the power of parametric modeling in Fusion 360 to design a phone, tablet or laptop stand that will be laser cut out of plywood or plexiglass. This project will use the entire design process.

- identifying the problem
- ideation and iteration
- refinement of ideas
- testing of ideas through physical models
- making of a digital model base on those tests
- outputting a physical prototype through a laser cutter

## Process

Initial Thinking

1. Think of the times that you use on a cell phone, tablet or laptop to see content on the screen. This could be video content, video chat, web browsing, a recipe while cooking, propped up while reading in bed or any other time the screen is on and you may want to be freehanded.
2. Think of the surfaces you may want the stand to work on. Consider what angle you want the device to be at and whether it would be vertical or horizontal.
3. Do you need to think about how the power cable would fit?
4. Do you need to think about where the power buttons and volume buttons are? What about the keyboard? Considering external devices connected?
5. Conduct research of existing solutions to the problem. You will not "copy" anything but you should be aware of what exists. It can inspire your and spark new ideas in your mind. Do an internet image search of [phone stands](https://www.google.com/search?q=phone+stands&tbm=isch), [tablet stands}(https://www.google.com/search?q=tablet+stands&amp;tbm=isch), [laptop stands](https://www.google.com/search?q=laptop+stands&tbm=isch) to get your brain buzzing.
6. Do an image search of [laser cut objects](https://www.google.com/search?q=laser+cut+objects&tbm=isch) to see what laser cutters can make.
7. Watch the [tutorial videos]() on the course page that show different types of [laser cut joints](). We will go over how to make our projects in Fusion 360 next week but you should be generally aware of these joining concepts as you design your prototype.

## Ideation Sketches

1. After this initial research, begin by drawing ideation sketches of solutions. At this stage try to draw many different ideas without censoring your thoughts. No idea is bad at this point.
2. Draw many ideas with different contours and solutions to the problem.
3. Draw a minimum of 10 ideation sketches of different designs and ideas. Each idea should be new and unique.
4. Draw your ideations sketches large enough. The maximum number of ideation sketches on a single page (~8.5"x11" sheet) is 6-8 sketches. Any more and they are too small.
5. You can make your sketches via analog or digital techniques or both. If you use digital techniques, the maximum number of ideation sketches on a single screen size document is 6-8 sketches. Any more and they are too small.

## Idea Sketch Refinement

1. After an initial out of ideation go back through your sketches and see which ones seem promising.
2. Choose five of these ideas and refine them and redraw them larger. Pay attention to showing how the pieces of the stand would go together. Try to draw them as solid things in three-dimensional space on your page.
3. Draw a minimum of 5 refined sketch ideas.
4. Draw your refined sketches large enough. The maximum number of refined sketches on a single page (~8.5"x11" sheet) is 2-3 sketches. Any more and they are too small.
5. You can make your sketches via analog or digital techniques or both. If you use digital techniques, the maximum number of refined sketches on a single screen size document is 2-3 sketches. Any more and they are too small.

## Physical Test Model

1. Choose one of these drawings and then get some cardboard to make a 1:1 scale model. We want the model to be accurate and full scale so we can test our ideas quickly.
2. It's important to use a cutting mat and a straightedge to cut cardboard quickly and cleanly. That way the model is a good representation of your idea.
3. Use a new blade on your cutter.

## Document the Design

1. After you assemble your model and test it then draw a third angle projection of your final design. Make sure to add dimensions to the third angle projection. You can measure from your cardboard model.
2. You can draw the third angle project at full scale or half scale depending on the size of your design.
3. Label the dimensions and views.

## Turning in Project

1. Scan your sketches and label the files.
2. Photograph your cardboard model from a minimum of 2 views.
3. Have good lighting and a good composition
4. Think about what is in the background, it should not be cluttered.
5. Use a piece of white butcher paper or white fabric attached to the wall to make a DIY photo sweep.
6. Place lights on both sides of the cardboard model to eliminate shadows. You can use the photo stand at the think[box]. Link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IEujUMfrwNqrz4M4hs8QsYuTGID2wZhnPJgkKJeSrsg/edit">instructions to use the photo table at the think[box]</a>.
7. Label your photos - YYYYMMDD Lastname First Name Project Name / Description
8. Put the sketches and photos in a labeled folder and upload to Google Drive.
9. Bring your sketches and cardboard model to class.

The laser cutter can only etch on to the surface of the material or cut all the way through. The router can make 3 dimensional cuts. It can round off the top and make three-dimensional sculptural forms by cutting away parts of the material. I can also make a pocket cut. A pocket cut is a cut that does not go all the way through the base material. This is not possible with a laser cutter.

We will use pocket cuts to secure different parts of our projects. This is a convenient way to make tabs on one part slot into another supporting piece. It is also way to hide the construction and undesirable joints that we don't want to see in the final design.

Additional joints that can be made by CNC machines are lap joints, mitered lap joints, t-lap joints, mortise and tennon joints, keyed mortise and tennon joints and many others. This [Google Image Search](https://google.com/search?q=cnc+joints&tbm=isch) shows a great variety of [CNC joints](https://google.com/search?q=cnc+joints&tbm=isch) to try in your project.
